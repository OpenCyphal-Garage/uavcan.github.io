# UAVCAN v0 (legacy)

This website is dedicated to the experimental version of the protocol, otherwise known as *UAVCAN v0*.
**This version is now obsolete and should not be used in new designs.**
Existing deployments will benefit from our commitment to provide long-term support and maintenance of
UAVCAN v0-based systems.

To learn about the stable version of the protocol, please read [**The UAVCAN Guide**](https://uavcan.org/guide).
