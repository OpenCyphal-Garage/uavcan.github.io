# UAVCAN

Lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotic applications via [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus).

## Key features

- Democratic network - no single point of failure.
- Publish/subscribe or request/response exchange semantics.
- Allows efficient exchange of large data structures.
- Lightweight, easy to implement protocol.
- Supports network-wide time synchronization with microsecond precision.
- Doubly- or triply- redundant CAN bus.
- Can be used in deeply embedded, resource constrained, hard real-time systems.
- The specification and reference implementation are open and free to use ([MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).
